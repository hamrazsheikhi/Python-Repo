# Python Parallelism, Concurrency, and AsyncIO - Illustrated 🐍

Enhance the performance of CPU-bound and IO-bound tasks using multiprocessing, threading, and AsyncIO.

## Setup Instructions 🛠️

1. Fork and Clone the repository.
2. Create and activate a virtual environment.
3. Install the required dependencies.

## IO-bound Operation Examples 📚

Run the following scripts to observe IO-bound operations:

```sh
$ python io-bound_sync.py
$ python io-bound_concurrent_1.py
$ python io-bound_concurrent_2.py
$ python io-bound_concurrent_3.py
